## [1.2.0] - 2024-06-XX

### Added
- Explicit documentation and demonstration of all minimum requirements for a modern RAG pipeline:
  - Full Python implementation (no low-code tools)
  - Semantic retrieval (FAISS + graph)
  - LLM response generation (Ollama/Mistral)
  - Embedding models, vector search, and prompt engineering
- Added Minimum Requirements Checklist to README and project summary
- Clarified that Streamlit is used only for visualization, not for retrieval/LLM logic

## [1.1.0] - 2024-06-XX

### Changed
- Removed unnecessary files: test_advanced_graphrag.py, demo.py, graphrag_optimizer.py, test_api.py, graph.html
- Streamlined project structure for efficiency and clarity
- Now only two main interfaces: advanced_graphrag.py (API/backend) and graphrag_streamlit.py (web UI)
- Knowledge graph is always auto-built from data.txt at startup
- Updated all documentation and markdown files for new structure
